# Hello MDX

This is a starter post to validate the MDX setup. You can drop future posts in
`content/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/slug.mdx` and control their visibility with the
`published` flag.

<Callout title="Draft-friendly" variant="info">
  Draft posts stay accessible in development, but they do not generate routes in
  production builds.
</Callout>

## Why this structure

- Dates are encoded in the folder path for easy grouping.
- Topics and tags live in frontmatter for filters later.
- Custom components like `<Callout />` are available without manual imports.

## Next steps

Try adding a second post with `published: false` and open the route locally.
